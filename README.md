Parts needed
-------------------
* GBA SP plug/audio cable sourced from: ([GBA SP Audio Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP#/media/File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Headphone-Adapter.jpg))
* GBA Link Plug, need to de-solder from one of the following: ([Link Cable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube_%E2%80%93_Game_Boy_Advance_link_cable) | [Wireless Adapter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Wireless_Adapter))
* DIY bt audio module: ([4.1 BT Transmitter Module, KCX_BT_EMITTER 5V](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33058710334.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.52ea4c4dOgsJLK) | [Need to find Aipods compatible version](about:blank))
* PCB made diy or eventually osh park...

Find the cheapest plug you can via GBA-GB link cable, I have not tried taking apart a link cable to scavenge those plugs, I am not sure if they will have PCB through hole pins. Using Wireless Adapters can get expensive unless you want to use the larger case!

You can find tons of SP audio cables on eBay for cheap.
